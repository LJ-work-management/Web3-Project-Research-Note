## Persistent Architecture
### Philosophy

One of the biggest goals for Enzyme v2 is to have upgradable funds. Finding an appropriate pattern was a challenging task because:
-   We have different types of contracts that comprise and are shared by funds, e.g., fund libraries, plugins (fees, policies, and DeFi adapters), infrastructure that can persist between releases, etc,
-   It is important to our philosophy for both fund managers and investors to have the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of every update (i.e., we can't change how a PerformanceFee works for every fund that is already using it)

### Vault Proxy
The "essential state" described above lives in per-fund `VaultProxy` contract instances, which are upgradable contracts following the EIP-1822 proxy pattern.

The `VaultProxy` specifies a `VaultLib` as its target logic, and these logic contracts are deployed per release, and swapped out during a migration.
A `VaultLibBaseCore` contract defines the absolutely essential state and logic for every VaultProxy. This includes:
-   a standard ERC20 implementation called `SharesTokenBase`
-   the functions required of a `IProxiableVault` called by the `Dispatcher`
-   core access control roles: `owner`, `accessor`, `creator`, and `migrator`

The `owner` is the fund's owner.
The `migrator` is an optional role to allow a non-owner to migrate the fund
The `creator` is the `Dispatcher` contract, and only this role is allowed to update the `accessor` and `vaultLib` values
